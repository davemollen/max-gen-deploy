# MAX gen~ MOD Deploy

This folder contains all the needed files to prepare a MAX gen~ object as LV2 plugin for MOD.
You only need to copy 2 files and give the plugin a name.
The MOD cloud will handle the plugin building, so no toolchain or cross-compiler is needed in this process.
Just a computer running Linux or macOS.


# Building the plugin
To begin, copy your gen_exported.cpp and gen_exported.h files into the main folder (where this README resides).
Then run 'mod-build.sh'.
It will ask you to give the plugin a name (you can optionally pass the name as arguments in command-line).
If everything goes well, the cloud should give back to you a tar.gz file.


# Deploying the plugin
After you build the plugin via MOD Cloud and got yourself a tar.gz file, run the 'mod-deploy.sh' script.
Note: make sure your MOD Duo is connected to your computer via USB.
